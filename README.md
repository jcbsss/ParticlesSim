2/2 MILESTONE 2/2
This is a munerical simulation project done for the Geophysical Laboratory I in the University of Warsaw. 

It is done accordingly to the paper: "The motion of small spherical particles in a cellular flow field" M. R. Maxey

The aim is to conduct a simulation of aerosol parcticles moving in a steady circular flow field. There will be gathered some statistics concerning particles' movement. 
Additional task is to optimize the code and use paralelization. I'm still learning Git

2/2 MILESTONE 2/2
This is my main part of a programme where I extend the basic simulation from 1 particle to miltiple particles. It is supposed to be optimized and parallelized.

Remarks
IMPROVE: initial positions function
EDIT: matlab code
ADD and RETHINK: some statistical functionalities
