This is a numerical simulation project done for the Geophysical Laboratory I in the University of Warsaw. 

It is done accordingly to the paper: "The motion of small spherical particles in a cellular flow field" M. R. Maxey

The aim is to conduct a simulation of aerosol parcticles moving in a steady circular flow field. There will be gathered some statistics concerning particles' movement. 
Additional task is to optimize the code and use paralelization. I'm still learning Git

This is my main part of a programme where I extend the basic simulation from 1 particle to miltiple particles. It is supposed to be optimized and parallelized.

I uploaded some examplous resulting videos.
