1 MILESTONE 1
This is a munerical simulation project done for the Geophysical Laboratory I in the University of Warsaw. 

It is done accordingly to the paper: "The motion of small spherical particles in a cellular flow field" M. R. Maxey

The aim is to conduct a simulation of aerosol parcticles moving in a steady circular flow field. There will be gathered some statistics concerning particles' movement. 
Additional task is to optimize the code and use paralelization. I'm still learning Git

I leave this working program for just 1 particle in a branch. It may be really usefull, so I will not overwrite it.
